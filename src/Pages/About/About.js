New York was already one of the leaders of cycling cities, however, no one gave visitors the opportunity to discover New York by bike. Soon, Newman and Flumbergen opened their first branch in the old bicycle factory. They also wanted to fulfil a function to the locals. So, apart from rental they also offered their services to repair bikes.</p>
